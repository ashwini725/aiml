steps of kmeans algo
choose the no of clusters k
select k random points from centroids
assign all the points to the closed cluster centroid
recompute the centroid of newly formed cluster 
repeat step 3 to 4
steps in em algorithm 
e step estimate the missing or latent variables
m step optimize the parameter of the model to explain data
steps in knn algorithm
select no of k neighbour
calc euclidean distance of k no of neighbour
select the k nearest neighbour as per calculation
among the neighbour count no of cluster points in each category
assign new datapoints to  tht category for which no of neighbour is max
kmean                             knn
unsupervised                      supervised
clustering                        classification
k's no of cluster                 k no of neighbour
